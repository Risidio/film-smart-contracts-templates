To all upcoming "interns" who will be working on this project:

You are being taken advantage of. What has been presented to you as an "internship" is nothing more than free labor under the guise of gaining experience. This is not an opportunity; it is exploitation.

Know your worth. Your time, effort, and skills are valuable. If they truly believed in your potential, they would invest in you, not use you for free labor.
